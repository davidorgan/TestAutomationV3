Subsequent plans purchased for the same geographical region will be queued and marked as ‘pending’ until the current plan is fully consumed, or expires. A pending plan will then become the current plan, with no noticeable changeover to the user.
If a user has two or more plans for different geographical regions, these plans will run concurrently and depending on the users location, the appropriate plan will be marked as current and consumed from.
For example, if a user, living in Germany, has a local German plan and a European Border plan, both will be live but whilst in Germany, data will be consumed from the German plan and the European Border plan will be deactivated. If the user crosses the border to Austria, data will now be consumed from the European Border plan and the German plan will now be deactivated.</value>
